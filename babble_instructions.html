<p>For each of the five candidates you've been assigned, you will be asked to provide a label and an explanation:</p>

<h4><strong>Label</strong></h4>
<p>Give a label that corresponds to the statement:</p>

<p>&nbsp;"The given text indicates that the highlighted people are married 
    (to each other), were married in the past, or are getting married."</p>

<p><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: Only use information from the text itself.&nbsp;We are more interested in whether or not the <em>given</em>&nbsp;<em>text</em>&nbsp;indicates that the people are married than we are in whether or not they are&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;married.</p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 700;">Statement</span></h4>

<p>Complete the sentence &quot;I chose this label because...&quot;&nbsp;with a reason supporting your choice of label. Your explanation must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Refer to the first highlighted person in the sentence as <strong>person1</strong> and the second as <strong>person2</strong> (instead of quoting their names)</li>
	<li>Result in a <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">complete sentence</span>&nbsp;(e.g., &quot;I chose this label because...the word &#39;wife&#39; is within two words of person2&quot;, not &quot;I chose this label because...&#39;wife&#39;&quot;)</li>
	<li>Place in <strong>double quotes</strong> any word from the sentence that you are quoting (other than person1 or person2).</li>
	<li>Be unique for each of the five different texts</li>
</ul>

<p>HINT: A common successful formula is to find a word or words that informed your decision, 
    and then state whether they occurred before/after/between person1 and/or person2, 
    or more specifically, within a certain number of words or characters in a certain direction
    to person1 or person2. Your explanation may also use compound statements, 
    refer to word attributes (spelling, capitalization, starts with, ends with, word count) 
    or specific word distances (within three words of, more than ten words away from, etc.).
    It's okay if your explanation won't always be true for other sentences; 
    just tell us about the words that informed your decision for this sentence.</p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 700;">Examples</span></h4>

<p>EXAMPLE 1:<br />
<strong>Text</strong>: &quot;Meanwhile, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Kate</span> and <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Michael</span> celebrated their second wedding anniversary last month.&quot;<br />
<strong>Label</strong>: True<br />
<strong>Explanation</strong>: I chose this label because...<br />
<span style="color:#009900;">good</span>: &quot;and&quot; is between person1 and person2 and the words &quot;wedding anniversary&quot; occur after person2.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">good</span>: the words &quot;their&quot; and &quot;wedding&quot; occur after person2.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">good</span>: person1 and person2 are within two words of each other and &quot;celebrated&quot; is after person2.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">bad&nbsp;</span>(real world knowledge): it says person1 and person2 have been married for two years.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">bad&nbsp;</span>(misuses quoted word): person1 and person2 had a &quot;wedding&quot;. [does not refer to&nbsp;position of &quot;wedding&quot; in the sentence]</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 2:<br />
<strong>Text</strong>: &quot;Education Minister <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Christopher Pyne</span> is tipped to take over Defense, while current Social Services Minister <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Scott Morrison</span> is predicted to move to Treasury, amid widespread expectations Joe Hockey&nbsp;will depart as treasurer.&quot;<br />
<strong>Label</strong>: False<br />
​<strong>Explanation</strong>: I chose this label because...<br />
<span style="color:#009900;">good</span>:&nbsp;person1 and&nbsp;person2 are both&nbsp;immediately preceded by the word &quot;Minister&quot;<br />
<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">good</span>: the last word of person1 is not the same as the last word of person2.<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000;">bad&nbsp;</span>(not grounded in specific words): the sentence does not say anything about them being married.<br />
<span style="color:#FF0000;">bad&nbsp;</span>(real world knowledge): person1 and person2 are both men.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 3:<br />
<strong>Text</strong>: &quot;Pictured: <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Jane</span> with husband Howard and eldest daughter <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Sophie</span><br />
<strong>Label</strong>: False<br />
​<strong>Explanation</strong>:<br />
<span style="color:#009900;">good</span>:&nbsp;&quot;daughter&quot; occurs within three words to the left of person2.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">good</span>:&nbsp;&quot;daughter&quot; is between person1 and person2.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">bad&nbsp;</span>("daughter" not quoted): person2 is person1&#39;s daughter.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">bad&nbsp;</span>(misuses quoted word): person2 is person1&#39;s &quot;daughter&quot;. [does not refer to&nbsp;position of &quot;daughter&quot;]</p>
